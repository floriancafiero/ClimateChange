    "content": "Let us proceed step by step. A) Please learn the following definition of "obstruction" in international negotiations. "Obstruction are of seven types. 1) Parallel Progress:	the delegation repeatedly and openly threatens to block progress on an item it is less concerned about, if insufficient progress is made on another issue that it does care about.
2) Repetition and Propagation: repeatedly proposing new agenda items on the matter and continuously invoking the issue under other agenda items. 
3) Postponement and Delay: trying to postpone actual decisions
4) Refusal to Negotiate: refusing to negotiate, invoking (unlikely) excuses. 
5) Holding Out: Refusing to join the consensus, either alone or with a small number of supportersâ€”for as long as possible.
6) Exploiting Coalitional Position:	Taking advantage of a specific position in a coalition, such as G-77 coordinator.
7) Procedural Blockage:	invoking procedural rules to delay the negotiations, crossing the fine line that exists between lodging genuinely held concerns over procedural issues in good faith, and deliberately using fine print to frustrate the negotiation process. "
